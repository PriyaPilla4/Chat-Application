# Project 2

Web Programming with Python and JavaScript

For the personal touch, I added a feature that lets the user send emojis with the messages

application.py : the main program for running the webpage
index.html: for entering display name
channel_list.html: to show the list of channels already created and to create a new channel
error.html: to show error page if use tries to create a channel with a name that already exists
channel.html: shows the channel and is used to send messages
